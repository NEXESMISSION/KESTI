## 🎯 Smart Filtering Logic

### How It Works:

The system combines **ALL active filters**:

```
Product shows IF:
  ✅ Name matches search term OR
  ✅ Category matches search term AND
  ✅ Matches selected category button AND
  ✅ Price >= Min Price AND
  ✅ Price <= Max Price
```

**Example:**
- Search: "cola"
- Category: "Drinks"
- Max Price: $3

**Result:** Only cola drinks under $3
