## üî¢ Stock Calculations

**In Stock:**
```
stock_quantity > low_stock_threshold
Example: 50 > 10 = In Stock ‚úì
```

**Low Stock:**
```
0 < stock_quantity <= low_stock_threshold
Example: 8 <= 10 = Low Stock ‚ö†
```

**Out of Stock:**
```
stock_quantity = 0
Example: 0 = Out of Stock ‚úó
```

**Not Tracked:**
```
stock_quantity = NULL
Example: No tracking enabled
```
