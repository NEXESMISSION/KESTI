# 🔧 Fix Vercel Deployment Error - Quick Guide

## ❌ Error You're Seeing:

```
Error: No Output Directory named "dist" found after the Build completed.
Framework Preset: Vite (WRONG!)
```

**Problem:** Vercel detected the wrong framework (Vite instead of Next.js)

---

## ✅ Solution: Update Vercel Settings (2 Minutes)

### Method 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click on your **KESTI** project

2. **Go to Settings**
   - Click **"Settings"** tab at the top
   - Click **"General"** in the left sidebar

3. **Update Framework Preset**
   - Scroll down to **"Build & Development Settings"**
   - Click **"Edit"** or the pencil icon
   - Framework Preset: Select **"Next.js"** from dropdown
   
4. **Update Build Settings**
   Set these values:
   ```
   Build Command:       next build
   Output Directory:    .next
   Install Command:     npm install
   Development Command: next dev
   ```

5. **Save Changes**
   - Click **"Save"**
   - Scroll to top and click **"Redeploy"**

---

### Method 2: Delete and Re-import (If Method 1 Doesn't Work)

If Vercel is stuck with wrong settings:

1. **Delete Current Deployment**
   - Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
   - Settings → General → Scroll to bottom
   - Click **"Delete Project"**
   - Type project name to confirm

2. **Re-import from GitHub**
   - Click **"Add New"** → **"Project"**
   - Select **"Import Git Repository"**
   - Choose: `NEXESMISSION/KESTI`
   - Vercel will auto-detect **Next.js** this time (because of vercel.json)

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Click **"Deploy"**
   - Wait for deployment to complete

## 🔍 Why This Happened

Vercel sometimes misdetects the framework when:
- Multiple framework config files exist
- Previous deployments cached wrong settings
- Framework wasn't explicitly specified

The `vercel.json` file I created should prevent this in the future.

---

## ✅ Verification

After redeploying, you should see:

```
✓ Framework Preset: Next.js
✓ Build Command: next build
✓ Output Directory: .next
✓ Deployment successful!
```

---

## 🚀 Expected Build Output

When deploying correctly, you'll see:

```bash
Running "next build"
Creating an optimized production build
Compiled successfully
Route (pages)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /                                     1.2 kB          80 kB
├ ○ /owner-dashboard                      5.3 kB          85 kB
├ ○ /pos                                  3.8 kB          83 kB
└ ○ /stock                                4.2 kB          84 kB
```

**Not this:**
```bash
× Error: No Output Directory named "dist" found
```

## 🔧 Common Issues

### Issue 1: Still Getting "dist" Error

**Solution:** 
- Method 1 didn't work
- Use Method 2 (delete and re-import)
- The vercel.json is now in your repo, so it will auto-detect correctly

### Issue 2: Environment Variables Missing

**Solution:**
1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. Redeploy

### Issue 3: Build Still Fails

**Check these:**
- Build logs in Vercel dashboard
- TypeScript errors (though we have `ignoreBuildErrors: true`)
- Missing dependencies in package.json
- Check if `.env` variables are set in Vercel

## 📋 Build Settings Reference

### ✅ CORRECT Settings (Next.js):
```
Framework Preset:      Next.js
Build Command:         next build
Output Directory:      .next
Install Command:       npm install
Development Command:   next dev
Node.js Version:       18.x or 20.x (recommended)
```

### ❌ WRONG Settings (What you had):
```
Framework Preset:      Vite
Build Command:         npm run build (should be next build)
Output Directory:      dist (should be .next)
```

---

## 💡 Prevention

The updated `vercel.json` file will prevent this from happening again:

```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "next build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next"
}
```

This explicitly tells Vercel: "This is a Next.js project!"

## 🎯 Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Go to Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Settings → General → Build & Development Settings
- [ ] Change Framework Preset to "Next.js"
- [ ] Set Build Command to "next build"
- [ ] Set Output Directory to ".next"
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Redeploy
- [ ] Check deployment logs
- [ ] ✓ Deployment successful!

---

## 📞 If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Click latest deployment
   - Look for specific error messages

2. **Check Environment Variables:**
   - Settings → Environment Variables
   - Make sure Supabase credentials are set

3. **Try Local Build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   If this fails locally, fix the errors first

4. **Check Next.js Version:**
   Your package.json has Next.js 14.0.4 - that's good!

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

- ✓ Build completes without "dist" error
- ✓ Shows "Next.js" as framework
- ✓ Deployment URL is accessible
- ✓ Your app loads correctly
- ✓ Images upload and display properly

---

**Follow Method 1, and your deployment should work perfectly!** 🚀

If you still see issues after following Method 1, use Method 2 (delete and re-import). The vercel.json file is now in your repo, so Vercel will correctly detect it as Next.js.
