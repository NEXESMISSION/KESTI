## 🔄 How It All Works Together

### **1. Making a Sale (POS)**
```
Customer buys Product A (Selling: $10, Cost: $6)
  ↓
Sale recorded
  ↓
Sale item saved with:
  - price_at_sale: $10
  - cost_price_at_sale: $6  ✅ NEW!
  - quantity: 1
```

### **2. Finance Calculations**
```
Revenue = $10 (selling price)
Cost = $6 (cost price)
Gross Profit = $10 - $6 = $4

If you have $1 in expenses:
Net Profit = $4 - $1 = $3 ✅

Profit Margin = ($3 / $10) × 100 = 30% ✅
```

### **3. Viewing Finances**
```
Finance Page Shows:
├── Revenue: $10
├── Costs: $6
├── Expenses: $1
├── Gross Profit: $4
└── Net Profit: $3 (THE REAL PROFIT!)
```

## 📊 Example Scenario

### **Your Business:**

**Products:**
- Water Bottle: Selling $2, Cost $1
- Sandwich: Selling $5, Cost $3

**Expenses:**
- Rent: $500/month (recurring)
- Electricity: $100/month (recurring)
- Repairs: $50 (one-time)

**Sales Today:**
- 10 Water Bottles
- 5 Sandwiches

**Finance Calculation:**

```
Revenue:
  (10 × $2) + (5 × $5) = $20 + $25 = $45

Costs:
  (10 × $1) + (5 × $3) = $10 + $15 = $25

Gross Profit:
  $45 - $25 = $20

Today's Expenses: $0
(Rent & Electricity are monthly, not today)

Today's Net Profit:
  $20 - $0 = $20 ✅

Profit Margin:
  ($20 / $45) × 100 = 44.4% 
  → "Excellent! 🎉"
```

**Month Total (30 days similar):**
```
Monthly Revenue: $45 × 30 = $1,350
Monthly Costs: $25 × 30 = $750
Monthly Gross: $600

Monthly Expenses:
  Rent: $500
  Electricity: $100
  Repairs: $50
  Total: $650

Monthly Net Profit:
  $600 - $650 = -$50 ⚠️
  → Need to increase sales or reduce costs!
```
